I created a database for my first real experiment. I contains thousands of images of a horse and a demon horse in the same pose in front of a black background. I hope that I can create a realistic looking demon horse/zebra from a real zebra image.

I just uploaded two images of my zebra-to-demon-horse dataset. At the moment I train a pix2pix algorithm (from coursera) to convert a zebra to a demon horse.
